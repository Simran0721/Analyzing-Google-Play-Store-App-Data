# App Store Insights

## Project Objective:
To gain valuable insights into the Google Play Store app ecosystem, identify popular categories, understand user preferences, and provide recommendations for app developers to optimize their app listings and improve user engagement.

## Data Sources & Queries:
- Data Source: Google Play Store App Data (You can obtain this data from various sources like Kaggle, Google Play Store API, or scraping techniques)
- Key Queries:
   - Total number of apps and categories
   - Distribution of apps by category
   - Average app ratings
   - Sentiment analysis of app reviews
   - Popular apps based on downloads and ratings
   - Correlation between app features (e.g., size, price) and user ratings

## Power BI Tools:
- Get Data: Import the app data into Power BI using the appropriate connector.
- Power Query Editor: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
- Visualizations:
   - Clustered Column Chart: To visualize app distribution across categories.
   - Line and Stacked Column Chart: To analyze app ratings over time and by category.
   - Donut Chart: To represent the proportion of free and paid apps.
   - Clustered Bar Chart: To compare app features (e.g., size, price) across categories.
- Interactivity:
   - Slicers: To filter data based on different criteria (e.g., category, rating).
   - Cards: To display key metrics (e.g., total apps, average rating).
   - Table: To view detailed app information.
   - Filtering: To drill down into specific app segments.
   - Format Pane: To customize the appearance of visualizations.
